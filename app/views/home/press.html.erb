		          <p class="date">September 30, 2013</p>
		          <p>
		         	 LONDON -- Proprietary wireless protocols are quickly losing their dominance in the healthcare market to more standards-based wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and IEEE 802.15.4. Over the next 5 years, Bluetooth Smart (formerly Bluetooth Low Energy) will lead in shipments and Wi-Fi will lead in revenues in the healthcare device IC market expected to exceed $100 million by 2018.

		          <p class="date">August 14, 2013</p>
		          <p>For a company like Apple that manages an ecosystem of integrated hardware, software and services, planning for future products means fitting new technologies into a coherent architecture that's already been developed. That can mean technologies, like NFC, that don't fit in, get bypassed and left behind. Technologies that do, and serve the customer, are embraced. That's why Apple is moving to Bluetooth SMART instead of NFC.</p>
