		          <p class="date">August 14, 2013</p>
		          <p>For a company like Apple that manages an ecosystem of integrated hardware, software and services, planning for future products means fitting new technologies into a coherent architecture that's already been developed. That can mean technologies, like NFC, that don't fit in, get bypassed and left behind. Technologies that do, and serve the customer, are embraced. That's why Apple is moving to Bluetooth SMART instead of NFC.</p>
