  app_industrial_ctrl_0: Industrial Control (Wireless Machine to Machine M2M)
  app_industrial_ctrl_1: Machine to Machine (M2M) refers to technologies that allow both wireless and wired systems to communicate with other devices of the same ability.[1][2] M2M uses a device (such as a sensor or meter) to capture an event (such as temperature, inventory level, etc.), which is relayed through a network (wireless, wired or hybrid) to an application (software program), that translates the captured event into meaningful information (for example, items need to be restocked).[3] Such communication was originally accomplished by having a remote network of machines relay information back to a central hub for analysis, which would then be rerouted into a system like a personal computer.
  app_industrial_ctrl_2: Sub 1GHz Tx/Rx
  app_wireless_monitors_0: Wireless Health Monitors
  app_wireless_monitors_1: Wireless Health Monitors are the integration of wireless technology into traditional medicine, such as diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of illness, as well as other tools that can help individuals improve their personal health and well-being. Wireless health solutions differ from normal health solutions in that; wireless health solutions will not always be mobile and mobile health solutions will not always be wirelessly enabled. Mobile broadband connectivity is useful in reaching new patients in remote areas while improving productivity and convenience through data transmission.
  app_wireless_monitors_2: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
  app_remote_controls_0: Advanced remote controls
  app_remote_controls_1: A Remote Control is a component of an electronic device, most commonly a television set, DVD player and home theater systems, originally used for operating the device wirelessly from a short line-of-sight distance. Remote control has continually evolved and advanced over recent years to include Bluetooth low energy connectivity, motion sensor-enabled capabilities and voice control.
  app_remote_controls_2: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
  app_tire_pressure_0: Tire Pressure Monitoring
  app_tire_pressure_1: A Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is an electronic system designed to monitor the air pressure inside the pneumatic tires on various types of vehicles. TPMSs report real-time tire-pressure information to the driver of the vehicle, either via a gauge, a pictogram display, or a simple low-pressure warning light. TPMSs can be divided into two different types â€” direct (dTPMSs) and indirect (iTPMSs). TPMSs are provided both at an OEM (factory) level as well as an aftermarket solution level.
  app_tire_pressure_2: Sub 1GHz Tx/Rx

The more modern networks are bi-directional, also enabling control of sensor activity. The development of wireless sensor networks was motivated by military applications such as battlefield surveillance. Today such networks are used in many industrial and consumer applications, such as industrial process monitoring and control, machine health monitoring, and so on.

  app_wireless_periphs_2: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
  app_wireless_meters_0: Wireless Smart Meters
  app_wireless_meters_1: A Wireless Smart Meter is usually an electrical meter that records the consumption of electric energy in intervals of an hour or less and communicates that information wirelessly at least once a day back to the utility for monitoring and billing purposes. [7] Smart meters enable two-way communication between the meter and the central system. Unlike home energy monitors, smart meters can gather data for remote reporting. Such an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) differs from traditional Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) in that it enables two-way communication with the meter.

  media_seg4_2: For a company like Apple that manages an ecosystem of integrated hardware, software and services, planning for future products means fitting new technologies into a coherent architecture that's already been developed. That can mean technologies, like NFC, that don't fit in, get bypassed and left behind. Technologies that do, and serve the customer, are embraced. That's why Apple is moving to Bluetooth SMART instead of NFC.
