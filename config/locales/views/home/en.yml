  app_industrial_ctrl_0: Industrial Control (Wireless Machine to Machine M2M)
  app_industrial_ctrl_1: Machine to Machine (M2M) refers to technologies that allow both wireless and wired systems to communicate with other devices of the same ability.[1][2] M2M uses a device (such as a sensor or meter) to capture an event (such as temperature, inventory level, etc.), which is relayed through a network (wireless, wired or hybrid) to an application (software program), that translates the captured event into meaningful information (for example, items need to be restocked).[3] Such communication was originally accomplished by having a remote network of machines relay information back to a central hub for analysis, which would then be rerouted into a system like a personal computer.
  app_industrial_ctrl_2: ISM Radio IP
  app_wireless_monitors_0: Wireless Health Monitors
  app_wireless_monitors_1: Wireless Health Monitors are the integration of wireless technology into traditional medicine, such as diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of illness, as well as other tools that can help individuals improve their personal health and well-being. Wireless health solutions differ from normal health solutions in that; wireless health solutions will not always be mobile and mobile health solutions will not always be wirelessly enabled. Mobile broadband connectivity is useful in reaching new patients in remote areas while improving productivity and convenience through data transmission.
  app_wireless_monitors_2: Bluetooth low energy IP
  app_remote_controls_0: Advanced remote controls
  app_remote_controls_1: A Remote Control is a component of an electronic device, most commonly a television set, DVD player and home theater systems, originally used for operating the device wirelessly from a short line-of-sight distance. Remote control has continually evolved and advanced over recent years to include Bluetooth low energy connectivity, motion sensor-enabled capabilities and voice control.

  app_tire_pressure_0: Tire Pressure Monitoring
  app_tire_pressure_1: A Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is an electronic system designed to monitor the air pressure inside the pneumatic tires on various types of vehicles. TPMSs report real-time tire-pressure information to the driver of the vehicle, either via a gauge, a pictogram display, or a simple low-pressure warning light. TPMSs can be divided into two different types — direct (dTPMSs) and indirect (iTPMSs). TPMSs are provided both at an OEM (factory) level as well as an aftermarket solution level.

  app_sensor_networks_0: Remote sensing Network
  app_sensor_networks_1: A Remote sensing Network consists of spatially distributed autonomous sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, pressure, etc., and to cooperatively pass their data through the network to a main location. The more modern networks are bi-directional, also enabling control of sensor activity. The development of wireless sensor networks was motivated by military applications such as battlefield surveillance. Today such networks are used in many industrial and consumer applications, such as industrial process monitoring and control, machine health monitoring, and so on.

[7] Smart meters enable two-way communication between the meter and the central system. Unlike home energy monitors, smart meters can gather data for remote reporting. Such an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) differs from traditional Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) in that it enables two-way communication with the meter.

  news_seg9_0: Silicon Vision partners with Mindtree to offer a complete Bluetooth Low Energy intellectual property solution for wireless personal area networks.
  news_seg9_1: 30 September 2013
  news_seg9_2: London, UK and Warren, NJ, USA, 30 September 2013 – Silicon Vision Technologies Ltd and Mindtree Ltd., a global information technology solutions company, have partnered to bring to market  a state-of-the-art, integrated RF-baseband-stack intellectual property (IP) solution for Bluetooth Low Energy (also known as Bluetooth Smart) technology. The integrated solution has already been proven with a lead customer in Asia, and will enable wireless personal area networks (WPAN) that rely on extremely low power consumption wireless connectivity.
  news_seg9_3: The two companies have successfully integrated Silicon Vision’s RF PHY (radio) intellectual property for Bluetooth low energy (BLE), with Mindtree’s product-proven, fully-qualified baseband (link layer) and low-footprint protocol stack. This integrated solution is compliant with Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 (single mode) specification with a highly competitive power consumption figure, enabling system-on-a-chip (SoC) designers to deliver power and area efficient chips for BLE using qualified and proven silicon over several nodes, including TSMC and SMIC.
  news_seg9_4: Commenting on the new partnership, Tarek Elesseily, CEO of Silicon Vision, said, “We have developed a unique licensable RF intellectual property solution that supports Bluetooth low energy. With Mindtree dominating the independent IP provider space worldwide for BLE baseband, protocol stack and profiles today, we believe that our integrated solution will help realize the vision of millions of consumer electronics products to operate wirelessly for months or even years on tiny cell batteries. Our aim is to be the market leader within this sector with our ultra-low power, fully integrated and quickly portable solution forming part of many consumer electronics products.”
  news_seg9_5: Vikram Srivats, general manager and global head of Mindtree’s engineering R&D service line, added, “We are enthusiastic about the Silicon Vision relationship. Mindtree’s investment in BLE technology spans more than 100 person-years, with several design wins and customer products shipping in volume already. Silicon Vision brings a silicon-proven RF-PHY solution for BLE, a strong team with ultra-low power RF expertise, and design services ability to quickly scale and meet customer requirements across foundries. With a fully integrated, silicon-proven, qualified and mature solution, our sales teams are already bidding together for new designs worldwide”.
  news_seg9_6: Markets for Bluetooth Smart devices include healthcare, sports and fitness, security, and home entertainment. According to industry analyst IMS Research, Bluetooth Smart will be present in 35 percent of all wireless sports and fitness monitoring devices (like pedometers and heart-rate monitors that run on small batteries) shipped this year, and in over 70 percent by 2018. Adding a sports and fitness monitor to a mobile phone can enhance the user experience via downloaded apps. Fitness parameters such as heart rate can be tracked more easily this way.
  news_seg9_7: In home entertainment, integration of this technology in remote controls can add functionality not possible with infrared technology – such as non-line-of-sight control, voice control, gesture control, touch control and motion detection. With these additional features, device manufacturers can create a richer control environment for consumers, such as in interactive smart TVs.

  media_seg4_0: Here’s Why Your iPhone Will Never Have NFC
  media_seg4_1: August 14, 2013
  media_seg4_2: For a company like Apple that manages an ecosystem of integrated hardware, software and services, planning for future products means fitting new technologies into a coherent architecture that's already been developed. That can mean technologies, like NFC, that don't fit in, get bypassed and left behind. Technologies that do, and serve the customer, are embraced. That's why Apple is moving to Bluetooth SMART instead of NFC.

  media_seg9_2: Since its inception, Bluetooth was supposed to be the definitive standard for 'personal area networks', connecting a myriad of devices in a cloud of radio activity around your body. Realistically, though, all we ever used it for was headsets and speakerphones. With the latest revision to the spec, Bluetooth 4.1, the technology is finally coming of age. And why not? After all, it's only been around for 20 years.
