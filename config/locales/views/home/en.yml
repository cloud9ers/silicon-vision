  app_industrial_ctrl_0: Industrial Control (Wireless Machine to Machine M2M)
  app_industrial_ctrl_1: Machine to Machine (M2M) refers to technologies that allow both wireless and wired systems to communicate with other devices of the same ability.[1][2] M2M uses a device (such as a sensor or meter) to capture an event (such as temperature, inventory level, etc.), which is relayed through a network (wireless, wired or hybrid) to an application (software program), that translates the captured event into meaningful information (for example, items need to be restocked).[3] Such communication was originally accomplished by having a remote network of machines relay information back to a central hub for analysis, which would then be rerouted into a system like a personal computer.

  app_wireless_monitors_0: Wireless Health Monitors
  app_wireless_monitors_1: Wireless Health Monitors are the integration of wireless technology into traditional medicine, such as diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of illness, as well as other tools that can help individuals improve their personal health and well-being. Wireless health solutions differ from normal health solutions in that; wireless health solutions will not always be mobile and mobile health solutions will not always be wirelessly enabled. Mobile broadband connectivity is useful in reaching new patients in remote areas while improving productivity and convenience through data transmission.
